# optee-security-test
Testing the security of an OP-TEE installation

### Dependencies
- [OP-TEE](https://github.com/OP-TEE)
- [Cross compiler for ARM](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-a)

### Overview
**optee-security-test** tests the behavior of an OP-TEE client when trying to run a trusted application (TA) signed with an incorrect key. The TA must not be executed in this case and the client API is expected to return a specific error.

### Details
[test-app](test-app) is an OP-TEE client application that is called in the REE. It in turn invokes a TA ([mock-ta](mock-ta)) in the TEE. *mock-ta* receives a value from the *test-app*, just multiplies it by a constant, and returns it. The *mock-ta* should work correctly because it was signed with the correct key that matches the OP-TEE OS.

[fake-ta](fake-ta) contains the same program code as *mock-ta* and has the same UUID. The only difference is that it was signed with a key that doesn't match the OP-TEE OS. The *test-app* only calls the TA using the UUID and doesn't care about signatures. The OP-TEE OS must recognize the invalid signature of the *fake-ta*, refuse execution of the *fake-ta* and return the error [TEE_ERROR_SECURITY](https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/8e74d47616a20eaa23ca692f4bbbf917a236ed94/lib/libutee/include/tee_api_defines.h#L126), which is then forwarded to the *test-app*.

The [qemu-run-test](qemu-run-test) script runs the test in the QEMU emulator. It calls the *test-app* three times and always copies *mock-ta* or *fake-ta* to the TA folder of the file system beforehand. The second time (with *fake-ta*) it expects the error code TEE_ERROR_SECURITY (0xffff000f).
